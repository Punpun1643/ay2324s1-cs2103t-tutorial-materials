# Q&As

**Q: Should test cases be in any particular order? For example, in the screenshot, it seems like it would be 'better' to slot `TC4` right after `TC1` as doing so we would have tested that SUT works for `rice`?**

**A:** The ordering of test cases might have an effect. In this module, we do not consider that aspect. In fact, there is a general guidance that one should not depend on tests running in a particular order as some hidden dependencies between test cases can hide bugs. In fact, some testing frameworks run tests in random order by default, to prevent such dependencies.

**Q: In the screenshot, is it necessary to have the label `<<facade>>`, and if so, should there also be label `<<command>>`?**

**A:** It is optional to add such `<<role>>` to elements of the diagram, to provide more information about a special role played by such an element.

**Q Can the `Job` class(es) play the role of `<<Observable>>`?**

**A:** Possible but not suitable as managing `<<Observer>>` objects goes beyond the responsibility of the `Job` class. `Process` class seems to have oversight on managing `Job` objects and is better suited for managing `Observer` objects as well. In any case, the `Job` objects might not even exist at the start of the execution.

**Q: Why don't we let the `Process` class be the facade?**

**A:** 

1. It already has other responsibilities

2. In the future, we might have to add more internal classes to the component that outsiders need to access. Accessing those through the `Process` class may not even make sense.

- Remember we had a discussion on equivalence partitions? During the tutorial, some of you combine 29, 30, 31 as one EP (i.e. [29..31]). 

EP are group of test inputs that are likely to be processed by the SUTs the same way. This also mean that they likely have the same logic/implementations handling these values. 

To help indentify EP, you can try to think whether the logic/implementation handling these values are different. In this case, 29, 30, 31 would likely have separate logics handling them. Hence, they form EP in themselves.

# Resources that I found useful for finals preparation

## Good cheatsheet

- I used [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/AaronCQL/serious-collection/tree/master/CS2103T) as a sanity check. I also used it as a quick reference during the finals in case I suddenly forgot anything (Note: This was not done by me, credits go to the creator).

## Code quality

- [Introduce assertion](https://refactoring.guru/introduce-assertion)

- [Guard clauses](https://refactoring.guru/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses)

## Design patterns

# How I prepared for finals

TLDR; if you really don't have time please do: study UML + look through the weekly quiz questions that you got wrong

1. Read through the entire module textbook one time, take note of things that I thought was noteworthy (again, I mentioned this countless times, maybe it's a good idea to have a list of the notations that shouldn't be included in each type of diagrams e.g. no multiplicity in object diagram)

2. Re-attempted all the weekly quizzes, take a screenshot of those that I still got wrong, then try to understand why I got them wrong. Revise those parts of the content. Look through these questions once again before exam.

3. Attempt past year papers under timed condition so I know my pace. 

4. I read most of the forum discussion for past year papers questions. 

5. I didn't make cheatsheet or notes. There was no time to look them up during the exam anyway.

# Tips

Some tips from me [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yjzExU_AEERoxOOIlMCXdjr9uBxhYpaf8ltHMUE95zM/edit?usp=sharing)

- All the best for PED/PE/Finals, hope you achieve what you want for yourself! Otherwise, as cliche as it may sound, grades are not the only thing in life. Try your best :)

- Feel free to ask me questions if you have any doubts! :)
